This is the home of the Pillbug KatamariSBC cluster. Pillbug will be the production cluster for the KatamariSBC project, eventually... For now, it's the only cluster, and so it is the dev cluster.
New development clusters may be brought online, they will have their own github pages if they are public.
Development progress will be cateloged here. Also included will be the cluster roadmap, operational status, specs, and wishlist.
Cyberbegging will be enganged in shameless and any funds are appreciated.
